## üèóÔ∏è 3. Architecture

**Structure:**
- RESTful API: Modular structure (controllers, routes, models, middlewares)
- Role-Based Access Control: Middleware authorization for roles like ADMIN, ORPHANAGE_ADMIN, DRIVER, SPONSOR, etc.
- Centralized Error & Role Handling (Middlewares like allowedTo, asyncWrapper, ...)
- Job Scheduler: node-cron handles automatic expiration and Stripe subscription cleanup.
- Webhook Listener: Handles Stripe subscription events.

**Justification:** Secure, scalable, and ideal for cloud/container environments.
